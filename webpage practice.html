				<h1> Do you know what blogs are? </h1>
				<p>  If you don’t, then you’ve come to the right place. <br> 
				In the beginning, a blog was more of a personal diary that people shared online, <br>
				and it goes back to 1994. In this online journal, you could talk about your daily <br>
				life or share things you do. But, people saw an opportunity to communicate any <br>
				information in a new way.So began the beautiful world of blogging.
				<h2> What is a Blog? </h2>
				<p> A blog (shortening of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website <br>
				displaying information in the reverse chronological order, with latest posts appearing first.<br>
				It is a platform where a writer or even a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.
			
				
				<h3> Blog structure  </h3>
				<h4> The appearance of blogs changed over time, and nowadays blogs include different items.<br> </h4>
				But, most blogs include some standard features and structure. Here are common features that a typical blog will include:<br>
				<ul>

                <li>Header with the menu or navigation bar</li>
                <li>Main content area with highlighted or latest blog posts</li>
                <li>Sidebar with social profiles, favorite content, or call-to-action</li>
